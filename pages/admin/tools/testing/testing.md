# Testing

To test a user's ability to view a list of records, view individual record details, 
and edit/create a record with validation in your PHP/HTML5 web application, you can follow these steps:

1. **Define Test Cases**:
   - **View List of Records**: Test that the list of records is correctly retrieved and displayed.
   - **View Individual Record**: Test that selecting a record displays its details accurately.
   - **Edit Record**: Test that the edit functionality allows modifying a record and correctly validates 
      input before saving.
   - **Create Record**: Test that the creation form correctly validates inputs and saves new records.

2. **Unit Testing (Backend)**:
   - Write PHP unit tests (using PHPUnit) to test the underlying functions/methods used to fetch, update, 
      and create records in the database.
   - Test validation logic to ensure it correctly handles valid and invalid inputs.

3. **Integration Testing (Backend)**:
   - Test the integration of your PHP scripts with the database. Ensure that queries are correctly executed 
      and return the expected results.
   - Test API endpoints (if used) that handle fetching, updating, and creating records.

4. **Functional Testing (Frontend)**:
   - **Automated Browser Testing** (Using Selenium or similar tools):
     - Automate the process of navigating to the list of records, ensuring the list loads correctly.
     - Automate the selection of an individual record and verify that the details are displayed correctly.
     - Test the edit functionality by automating the process of editing a record, ensuring validation works 
        and changes are saved.
     - Test the create functionality by automating the process of entering new record details, ensuring 
        validation works and the record is created.
   - Include tests for different browsers and devices to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

5. **Manual Testing**:
   - Manually test the UI to ensure that the list of records, individual record details, 
      and the create/edit forms are user-friendly and work as expected.
   - Test edge cases that might be difficult to cover with automated tests.

6. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Have actual users test these functionalities in a staging environment. 
      This helps identify usability issues and real-world bugs that automated tests might miss.

7. **Performance Testing**:
   - If the list of records is large, perform load testing to ensure the system performs well under heavy usage.

8. **Security Testing**:
   - Ensure that only authorized users can view, edit, and create records.
   - Test for common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection, especially in create/edit functionalities.

9. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Integrate these tests into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure they are run regularly.

10. **Documentation**:
   - Document your tests, including how to run them and interpret their results. 
      This is useful for maintaining consistency in testing as your application evolves.

By following these steps, you can comprehensively test the functionalities of viewing, 
editing, and creating records in your web application, ensuring both the backend logic and 
frontend interface work correctly and securely.
